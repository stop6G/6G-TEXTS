### **ZERO TRUST**

OK, let's admit it... **"Never Trust, Always Verify"** actually sounds very good. It sounds safe.

Technically, it is the foundational slogan of the entire **Zero Trust** [36] doctrine. It was originated by **Forrester Research** [37], consecrated by the **US NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology) [38], and finally adopted by the European **xTrust-6G** project as their **Core Design Principle** [39].

But... we better slow down and start from the beginning.

To understand WTF **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** is and why it is a nightmare, we must understand the old models first.

In the era of 3G and 4G, security was based on the **"Perimeter Model"** (often called the "Castle and Moat") [40]. You typed your password once, you entered the network (firewall/login), and you were trusted. You could roam freely inside.

**5G** moved to a hybrid system named **"Network Slicing"** [41]. This is the idea: your SIM card allows you to enter *only* the parts of the network that belong to, let's say, **"Slice #303."** You are segregated. Operators isolate users into specific "slices" with different rules and permissions.

In 2010, **John Kindervag**, a principal analyst at Forrester Research, looked at these models and said: *"Puagh!"* He proposed a radical solution: **"Trust is a vulnerability. We need to eliminate trust."**
He called it **Zero Trust** [37].

In this new model, there is no "inside." The network treats **everyone** as a hostile threat.
It checks you every single time you try to move... and you must prove that you are still... **YOU.**

For ten years, this was just a corporate theory for IT departments. But in **2020**, the **US Government (NIST)** turned this theory into a **Federal Standard** [38]. They wrote the "bible" of Zero Trust (SP 800-207), effectively mandating that this paranoia become the default architecture for the entire digital world.

And now, with **xTrust-6G** [39], the European Union is building this logic directly into the 6G mobile network.

But 5G still has a "fatal flaw" for the surveillance state: **It is blind.**
It trusts the *Device* (the phone), not the *User* (the human). It cannot see *you*. If I steal your unlocked 5G phone, the network trusts me completely because I am holding the authorized object.

**6G** closes this gap.
The core principle of Zero Trust 6G is that **Identity is not a token; it is a performance.**
It is not enough to *have* the phone. You must *be* the user. The network uses the ISAC layer (see *Section 001*) to continuously verify your biological reality. This is done with **"Continuous Authentication"** [42] via **Behavioral Biometrics**.

The network builds a **"Trust Score"** [43] for you in real-time based on:

**Your Gait:** The rhythm of your walk (detected by ISAC radar).
**Your Biology:** Your heartbeat and breathing patterns.
**Your Behavior:** The way you hold your phone, your typing speed, and your location history [44].

If your "Trust Score" drops (you walk strangely because you are injured, or the algorithm flags a "conflict" in a crowd), the network instantly revokes your access. You don't get a trial. You don't get a phone call. The algorithm simply decides you are no longer "You."

This shifts the burden of proof. In a free society, the state must prove you are guilty to search you. In a Zero Trust 6G society, **you must continuously prove you are innocent to be connected.** You are no longer a citizen with rights; you are a **"Permanent Suspect"** under digital parole, where the check-in officer is an AI that never sleeps.

Eh! No sci-fi here... look at **xTrust-6G**.
Launched in **January 2025** by the European Union, this massive project is currently building the **"User Behavior Policy Engines"** [45] that will power this system. Their stated goal? To establish "Zero Trust" by leveraging **"behavioral insights gathered from the 6G infrastructure."** [46]
The cage is being welded together as we speak.
