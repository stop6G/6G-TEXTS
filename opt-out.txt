### **OPT-OUT**

6G is not about speed, or let's say, not *only* about speed. The fact that in 4 years from now (approx) you will be able to download a movie 100 times faster than today becomes quasi-anecdotal compared with the deeper changes that 6G will bring to your everyday existence.

1G brought analog voice mobility. 2G was the digital revolution: voice and text. 3G brought data, incorporating mobile internet. 4G brought speed, fast connections for video and data. 5G brought capacity: smart cities, massive connections, internet of things [1]. So what is 6G about then?

One of the most important changes that 6G will bring will be the **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)** [2] capabilities. This technology, earlier also called JCAS (Joint Communication and Sensing) [3], will simply turn the network into a high-precision radar by harvesting reflection data from the same waves that carry your communication signals [4]. The network will have the ability to reconstruct the environment, detect and track your presence, location, speed, and even more sophisticated metrics like your heartbeat and breathing [5] by analyzing how waves scatter, diffract, and reflect. These waves will not only carry that Netflix movie to your iPhone 23; they will return to the Base Station [6] with information about the environment.

One could say: "It knows a person is there, but it doesn't know it's me." Wrong. It does this continuously, in time and space, so anonymity fails hard [7]. Home/work pairing? Gait analysis [8]? Retroactive identification? It will just "rewind" your entire past history to see everywhere you went before it knew your name [9] [10]. You become a part of the network actively (using your devices) or passively (being sensed by the network). Your guess is correct: this will be all AI-driven, not just because of the crazy scale of data to analyze, but because 6G is **AI-native technology** [11]. AI is part of the network itself.

"But I could just hide!" OK... let us tell you about **RIS (Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces)** [12]. If ISAC is the camera, RIS would be the flashlight. Imagine a programmable material distributed on facades, ceilings, windows, walls, and street signs, capable of acting like a smart mirror, bouncing the signal from the Station to your hiding place (calculating and re-calculating it) and bouncing back to the Station again. It simply puts you in line-of-sight [13].

If we were talking about sci-fi, this would be the "WormCam" tech by Clarke & Baxter [14], the "SeeChange" tech by Eggers [15], the "Telescreen" of *1984* [16] without the blind spots (RIS solves this), the city built of glass in *We* [17], and many more examples.

But, sadly, we are not talking about sci-fi. The **ITU (International Telecommunication Union)**, the UN agency that defines what "G" means, published the official framework for 6G in November 2023, aka *Recommendation ITU-R M.2160* [18]. ISAC is listed as a **Primary Usage Scenario**. Let's say: A network that cannot sense the environment is technically not a 6G network. RIS is listed as a **Technology Enabler** [19].

The **3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project)**, the global organization that writes the technical specifications in which mobile nets operate, officially established a "Study Item" dedicated to ISAC [20]. In their document *3GPP TR 22.837: Study on Integrated Sensing and Communication*, they detail 32 scenarios where the network senses you [21]. Some of these scenarios are obviously **"DEVICE FREE"** [22], which means the target has no device and is non-cooperative... but let's come back to this later. Please allow us to enumerate the use cases, just for the fun of it:

> *Intruder detection in smart home, Pedestrian/animal intrusion detection on a highway, Rainfall monitoring, Transparent Sensing Use Case, Sensing for flooding in smart cities, Intruder detection in surroundings of smart home, Sensing for railway intrusion detection, Sensing Assisted Automotive Maneuvering and Navigation, AGV detection and tracking in factories, UAV flight trajectory tracing, Sensing at crossroads with/without obstacle, Network assisted sensing to avoid UAV collision, Sensing for UAV intrusion detection, Sensing for tourist spot traffic management, Contactless sleep monitoring service, Protection of Sensing Information, Health monitoring at home, Service continuity of unobtrusive health monitoring, Sensor Groups, Sensing for Parking Space Determination, Seamless XR streaming, UAVs/vehicles/pedestrians detection near Smart Grid equipment, AMR collision avoidance in smart factories, Roaming for sensing service of sports monitoring, Immersive experience based on sensing, Accurate sensing for automotive manoeuvring and navigation service, Public safety search and rescue or apprehend, Vehicles Sensing for ADAS, Coarse Gesture Recognition, Sensing for automotive manoeuvring when not served by RAN, Blind spot detection, Integrated sensing and positioning in factory hall.*

The **Use Case #27**, "Public safety search and rescue or apprehend," exemplifies perfectly the difference between user/target, device/device-free, cooperative/non-cooperative, passive monitoring/active hunting. "Search and Rescue" is a humanitarian term; it means finding a victim who wants to be found (cooperative). "Apprehend" is a policing term; it means finding a suspect who does not want to be found (non-cooperative, device-free) [23]. Use Case #27 admits that the exact same technology used to save a firefighter in a burning building will be used to track a protestor running from the police. Consent is irrelevant. It confirms that the 6G network is a system that can isolate, track, and guide the capture of any human being, anywhere in the coverage area, based on their physical presence [24].

Wait a second... coverage area? That actually means **Planet Earth**.
6G promises "Ubiquitous Connectivity" aka "3D coverage" [25] [26]. The entire surface of the planet, including oceans, deserts, and the sky will be the new "coverage area." The official 6G architecture (as defined by ITU and 3GPP) calls for a "**Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Network**" [27]. NTN (Non-Terrestrial Networks) is the unified architecture that extends 6G coverage beyond the ground [28]. We can divide it into 3 layers: **HAPS** (High Altitude Platform Stations—solar-powered gliders, airships, or balloons), **LEO** (Low Earth Orbit—moving satellite swarms creating a web), and **GEO/MEO** (Geostationary/Medium Earth Orbit—satellites that appear "fixed" in the sky, moving at the same speed as Earth's rotation) [29] [30].

**GOING OFF-GRID MEANS LEAVING THE PLANET.** And that makes the possibility to **OPT-OUT** practically impossible. But what is exactly "opt-out" and why do we consider it so important? Easy.

Let's define "to opt-out" as to choose to **NOT** participate in a program. In the digital age, this is the ultimate expression of **Consent**.

For the last 30 years (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G), "Opting-Out" was difficult, but possible: I was free to not use a phone. One could leave it at home. The other could remove the battery. You could throw the SIM card in a river. They could move to a cabin in the woods where there was no signal. We were **"Users."**

6G changes the ontological status of the human being. You are no longer a "User"; you are a **"Target."** Participation is no longer a choice; it is a property of your existence. To "opt-out" of a network that covers the entire planet (Space-Air-Ground) and senses physical matter, you would effectively need to stop reflecting radio waves. You would need to become a ghost.

This creates a fundamental violation of what legal scholars Warren and Brandeis called "**The Right to be Left Alone**" [31], the very foundation of modern privacy law. It is a power that knows everything about you to shape your behavior, without you knowing anything about it [32]. Even the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 12) states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy" [33]. But... how can interference be avoided when the air itself is watching you?

The **Global Union Against Radiation Deployment from Space (GUARDS)** has long argued that satellite constellations create a unique legal crisis: **Involuntary Global Exposure**. Unlike terrestrial networks, where one can theoretically move to a "white zone" (an area with no signal), a satellite mesh covers the entire planet. They argue this violates human rights covenants (such as the Nuremberg Code) because it removes the physical possibility of withholding consent. In the 6G era, this shifts from "involuntary radiation" to **"involuntary sensing"**: meaning no human on Earth can legally or physically "opt-out" of being watched [34].

And here we are. **The clock is ticking louder than you think.**
The ITU has targeted 2030 for the commercial launch. That sounds distant, but it is a mirage. The technical standards—the DNA of this new network—are being written **right now** [35]. We are in the final window of opportunity. Once the satellites are launched and the hardware is soldered, the architecture of surveillance becomes permanent. There is no software update that can fix a physics problem.

The infrastructure of this 'Internet of Bodies' is being built above our heads and under our feet. We cannot "opt-out" of physics, but we can opt-out of silence.

Resistance is no longer about throwing away your phone; it's about refusing to let the world become a digital panopticon. Your awareness is the first line of defense. Talk to your neighbors. Share this knowledge. Demand transparency from your local representatives. This technology relies on our ignorance to spread; let's disrupt it with the truth.

The battle started today.
Enjoy the fight.

Sincerely yours,

[10] **Note on Storage Feasibility:** A common counter-argument regarding retroactive tracking is the sheer volume of data required. However, **metadata persistence** makes this feasible. As detailed in the *Hexa-X-II Cross-Layer Perspective*, 6G networks are designed to perform "feature extraction" at the edge. The network does not need to store raw radar waveforms; it only needs to store extracted **vector data** (coordinates, timestamps, gait signatures). This makes storing years of "movement history" computationally trivial.

[26] **Note on the Physics of Surveillance:** A technical critic might argue that a satellite 600km away cannot detect a human heartbeat due to signal attenuation (the **Radar Range Equation**). This is correct regarding *space-based* sensing: basic LEO satellites are generally limited to tracking larger objects (vehicles, ships) or groups. However, the system is layered (See Note [30]).

[30] **Note on Layered Resolution:** This is why the **HAPS** layer is the critical "missing link." Operating in the stratosphere (only 20km up), HAPS platforms overcome the attenuation problem, providing the high-resolution "zoom" capable of identifying individuals that space satellites cannot see. The system functions like a multi-stage telescope.
